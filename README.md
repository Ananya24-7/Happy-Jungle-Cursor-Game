Features

 Interactive Characters: A circle of colorful cartoon characters that surround a central button.
 Eye-Tracking Mouse Effect: All characters' eyes follow the user's mouse cursor in real-time, creating a lively and engaging feel.
 Dynamic Theme Transformation: Click the central button to switch between two distinct themes:
 Happy Mode: Features a bright blue sky, a shining sun, white clouds, and the welcoming message "Welcome to the Happy Jungle".
 Dark Mode: Transforms the scene into a creepy atmosphere with a dark purple background, a glowing moon, and the ominous message "I am watching you".
 Character Morphing: In Dark Mode, the characters' colors darken, their eyes turn red, and their pupils enlarge to enhance the spooky effect.
